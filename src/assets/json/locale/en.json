    "text": "ðŸ‘‹ <g>Hi! I'm Ramiro</g>, and I love what I do. <span>I fell in love with programming</span> from the very first moment, and since then, I haven't stopped exploring the world of technology. I surround myself with others who are passionate about this universe, and without a doubt, I am one of them.).<br><br>Since I was a kid, I always had that <span>curiosity</span> to understand how things worked. I would take apart any toy, device, or game that came into my hands just to discover what made it <span>work</span> and then try to put it back together (with more or less success ðŸ˜†).<br><br>Today, as a <span>web developer</span>, I specialize in Frontend. I love continuing to learn, sharing knowledge, and receiving feedback that helps me improve.).<br><br>And, of course, there's no code without a <span>good mate</span>. For me, the best moments come with oneâ€”whether it's chatting with friends or long hours of programming. Because if there's something that's always present, it's mate and the desire to keep creating and growing. ðŸš€ðŸ§‰"
